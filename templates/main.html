                <h2><strong>"Oblivion can only be fought with memory, literature, words and archives"</strong></h2>
                <p>The name of the magazine, Oblivious, arises from the feeling of oblivion we feel when we perceive the difficulty for young authors and creators to make a niche for themselves in the current literary scene.</p>
                <p>In an era in which the mass media monopolize practically all possibilities, it is difficult to promote oneself adequately. The potential that many people possess does not manage to see the light despite the effort they make, and university studies do not help this community to develop as a literary generation.</p>
                <p>Therefore, from Oblivious we want to offer a space that gives a boost to all those people who are interested in being part of the literary community in one way or another. We want to give a voice to bookstores, authors and content creators, in order to spread their skills and works and free them from the oblivion that prevents them from growing.</p>
